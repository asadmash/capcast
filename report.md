# Debugging Report: Resolving `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')`

This report details the process of identifying and resolving a `TypeError` that occurred in the application. The error prevented the video list from rendering on the main page.

## 1. Problem Description

The application threw a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')` at [`app/(root)/page.tsx:22`](<app/(root)/page.tsx:22>). This error indicated that the `videos` object, which was expected to be an array of video data, was `undefined` at the time of rendering. The code was attempting to access `videos[0].video.title`, which failed because `videos` itself did not exist.

```tsx
// app/(root)/page.tsx - Error Location
<section className="video-grid">{videos[0].video.title}</section>
```

## 2. Initial Diagnosis

The initial investigation involved two key files:

- **[`app/(root)/page.tsx`](<app/(root)/page.tsx:1>):** The component where the error occurred. It calls the `getAllVideos` server action to fetch data.
- **[`lib/actions/video.ts`](lib/actions/video.ts:1):** The server action responsible for querying the database and returning the list of videos.

An attempt to use `console.log(videos)` inside the `Page` component in [`app/(root)/page.tsx`](<app/(root)/page.tsx:1>) confirmed that the `videos` variable was indeed `undefined`. However, this only showed the symptom, not the cause. The investigation then focused on the data flow from the server action to the component.

## 3. Root Cause 1: Incorrect `leftJoin` in `lib/actions/video.ts`

The first issue was found in the `buildVideoWithUserQuery` function within [`lib/actions/video.ts`](lib/actions/video.ts:1). The `drizzle-orm` `leftJoin` syntax was incorrect.

The query was attempting to join the `videos` and `user` tables, but the condition `eq(videos, userId, user.id)` was syntactically wrong. The correct syntax requires comparing two columns, such as `eq(videos.userId, user.id)`. This error caused the database query to fail or return a malformed result, leading to no video data being passed to the component.

**Before:**

```typescript
// lib/actions/video.ts - Incorrect Join
const buildVideoWithUserQuery = () => {
  return db
    .select({
      video: videos,
      user: { id: user.id, name: user.name, image: user.image },
    })
    .from(videos)
    .leftJoin(user, eq(videos, userId, user.id)); // Incorrect
};
```

**After:**

```typescript
// lib/actions/video.ts - Corrected Join
const buildVideoWithUserQuery = () => {
  return db
    .select({
      video: videos,
      user: { id: user.id, name: user.name, image: user.image },
    })
    .from(videos)
    .leftJoin(user, eq(videos.userId, user.id)); // Correct
};
```

## 4. Root Cause 2: Incorrect Destructuring in `app/(root)/page.tsx`

The second issue was discovered in [`app/(root)/page.tsx`](<app/(root)/page.tsx:1>). The [`getAllVideos`](lib/actions/video.ts:145) function returns an object with `videos` and `pagination` properties: `{ videos: [...], pagination: {...} }`.

However, the component was attempting to destructure this return value as if it were an array: `const [videos, pagination] = await getAllVideos(...)`. This resulted in both `videos` and `pagination` being `undefined`, as array destructuring does not work on an object in this manner.

**Before:**

```typescript
// app/(root)/page.tsx - Incorrect Destructuring
const [videos, pagination] = await getAllVideos(
  // Incorrect
  query,
  filter,
  Number(page) || 1
);
```

**After:**

```typescript
// app/(root)/page.tsx - Corrected Destructuring
const { videos, pagination } = await getAllVideos(
  // Correct
  query,
  filter,
  Number(page) || 1
);
```

## 5. Resolution

The `TypeError` was resolved by applying two critical fixes:

1.  **Correcting the Database Query:** The `leftJoin` syntax in [`lib/actions/video.ts`](lib/actions/video.ts:52) was fixed to correctly join the `videos` and `user` tables. This ensured that the server action could successfully fetch the video data from the database.
2.  **Correcting the Data Destructuring:** The array destructuring in [`app/(root)/page.tsx`](<app/(root)/page.tsx:10>) was changed to object destructuring. This allowed the component to correctly receive the `videos` array and `pagination` object returned by the `getAllVideos` action.

With both the data retrieval logic and the component's data handling corrected, the `videos` variable was properly populated, and the application could render the video grid without error.
